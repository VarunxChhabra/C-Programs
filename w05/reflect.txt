Ans 1 - There are two possible ways one by done using if-else statements and another is done by using switch case
        By If else
            if (month == 11)
            {
                printf("NOV");
            }
            else if (month == 12)
            {
                printf("DEC");
            }
           else 
            {
            }

        By Switch and case
            case 11:
                {
                    printf("\n*** Log date set! ***\n");
                    printf("\nLog starting date: %d-NOV-01", year);
                    flag = 1;
                }
            case 12:
                {
                    printf("\n*** Log date set! ***\n");
                    printf("\nLog starting date: %d-DEC-01", year);
                    flag = 1;
                }
                break; 

Ans 2 - I had used two types of iteration in my code to validate the logic the first one is 
"for" I used it because I have to run the loop for the user to enter the values of morning and evening ratings three times only
"do-while" I used it because I have to run the loop once at least for the user to enter the value of year and month in the starting
and at the end where the user has to enter the rating values, The code must go on if the user enters the wrong value for this I have
to use the do-while loop.

Ans 3 - I used local windows debugging for finding syntactic and semantic problems while doing the code I used Array in my code for
the very first time and I want that array should have 3 values but I coded it as morning_ratings[2] i.e that it stores only two values
 when I run this code it was showing the error and using debugging tool option I was able to break my code into pieces and found that
 error and change to correct one that is morning_ratings[3] another when I forget to add .1 in front of lf and this syntax error was also corrected by using the Local windows 
debugger.
