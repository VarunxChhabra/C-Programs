Ans 1 - We use parallel arrays to link data of the table containing Items, Priority, Financed, and cost.
we use different arrays to take the value of each variable that was told in the output and then combine
all the arrays by forming a for-loop in the code to make it run and show the exact value that was mentioned
in different arrays one by one. The key for doing this is by forming a for loop in which the counter variable goes 
through all the parallel arrays which was equal to 0 at the initial stage and then changes to 1,2,3 and so on
till the list items.The combined code for parallel arrays is given below
 
printf("\nItem Priority Financed        Cost\n");
    printf("---- -------- -------- -----------\n");
    for (counter = 0; counter < list_items; counter++)
    {
        printf("  %d      %d        %c    %11.2lf\n", item_no[counter], priority[counter], financing_option[counter], item_cost[counter]);
}

Ans 2 - This is because the value stored in arrays starts from 0, not from 1 if we start iteration with one the value
of arrays that we going to print will not be printed for the value of the very first array i.e the value which is stored
in array 0 will not be printed for example :-

printf("\nItem Priority Financed        Cost\n");
    printf("---- -------- -------- -----------\n");
    for (counter = 0; counter < list_items; counter++)
    {
        printf("  %d      %d        %c    %11.2lf\n", item_no[counter], priority[counter], financing_option[counter], item_cost[counter]);
}

In this code, if I put counter = 1 then the value of all the arrays which is stored in 0 i.e the very first value stored 
in each array will not be printed.

Ans  3 - Array is a kind of variable where one can store the multiple values only in one variable by declaring how many 
values that are going to store in an array this can be done without declaring another variable for storing the same kind of value
for example, if you want to store student's names you don't need to declare the name variable with different names to store the name
of students here, we can use an array instead. We can easily access the arrays by storing values at the time of declaration or by taking
the user inputs for the same value by creating a loop.
