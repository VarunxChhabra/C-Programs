Ans 1 - "ReportData" structure minimally requires 60 bytes of data in memory. Bypassing the required value through 
         the functions it only occupies 4 bytes instead of 60 bytes which makes the program effective as it consumes 
         less memory it becomes faster and also become more convenient to understand.

      Example - void displayReportData(const struct ReportData report, const int cheapest)

Ans 2 - "ReportData" can be improved by putting the structure CatFoodInfo as an object in report data so that it becomes
         easier to understand and we don't require to create another structure with the same objects that used in another
         different structure.
         for exmaple printf("%d",ReportData.CatFoodInfo.sku);
         This command is used to print the value of sku which is stored in one structure Moreover, the value was stored in 
         both ReportData and CatFoodInfo at once for two different structures.
