Ans1 Using structure results in reducing the complexity and the size of the code by using structure one can easily save his or her
     time because we don't need to declare the variable of the same type at each time in the code by using the structure we can
     group it in the one main variable. For example, we have used structure in our code for storing the player and game information
     
struct PlayerInfo
{
    char character_symbol;
    int number_of_lives;
    int Treasure;
    int Player_History[Max_Length];
};
struct game
{
    int path_length;
    int number_of_moves;
    int Bomb_location[Max_Length];
    int Treasure_location[Max_Length];
};

int main(void)
{
    int counter1, counter2;
    int min = 3;
    int max = 26;
    int flag1 = 0;
    int flag2 = 0;
    int nextmove = 0;
    struct PlayerInfo player;
    struct game playergame;
    player.Treasure = 0;
   

Ans 2 For this I will first create two different variables in which one is used to record the history of the results and another is used
      is used to keep the end game result and this is how we can get the required output.

Ans 3 In this workshop I found whole code for part 2 was quite difficult for me at the first sight when I see the code I was able to figure 
      out what we gonna do in this but when I start applying logic to my code it starts giving me a lot of errors in printing the desired output
      So, for overcoming this problem I re-attend my lecture, and go through the weekly readings, take some help from my friends..this help me in 
      understanding the logic however it was tough challenge for me to  complete it before the deadline but it has increased my logical thinking
      capacity to a greater extent
